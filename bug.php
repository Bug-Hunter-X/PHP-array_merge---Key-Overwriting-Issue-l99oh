This code snippet demonstrates a common error in PHP related to improper handling of array keys when using array_merge().

```php
<?php
$array1 = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2];
$array2 = ['b' => 3, 'c' => 4];

$mergedArray = array_merge($array1, $array2);

print_r($mergedArray);
// Output: Array ( [a] => 1 [b] => 3 [c] => 4 )
?>
```

The issue is that `array_merge()` will overwrite existing keys when merging arrays, not append the values.

This behavior might be unexpected in certain scenarios and lead to incorrect results.  A better approach would be to use `+` operator to merge associative arrays without overwriting keys, or using `array_replace()` or other suitable functions based on your needs.
